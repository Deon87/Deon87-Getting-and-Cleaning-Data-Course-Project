The GitHub repository for this project contains these following files for completing the project.


  1) run_analysis.R - the R code for extracting, cleaning, and merging the train and test datasets      used to analyze the experiment performed with signal sensors of accelerometer and gyroscope        from Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone.
  
  2) TidyData.txt - The resulting dataset from R code manipulations on the train and test datasets.
  
  3) CodeBook.md - the file describes the features of the accompanied files from the experiment,the      R code data extracting, filtering, and merging processes of the train and test datasets, and       finally the empirical data from the experiment measured to reach a conclusion  of the              experiment.   .
  
  4) UCI HAR Dataset- Dataset extracted from the zip file downloaded from the website dedicated        for the smartphone experiment.It includes the necessary files and instructions needed to           complete the course project, including its very own detailed and understandable readme.
